This is a raytracer I wrote once since I didn't think I knew enough math.
I never actually got a chance to use any 3D matrices, so I still don't know them,
but I think there were some neat parts in here.

I don't like raytracing anymore, though; it's good for refraction but good
antialiasing and textures are too hard. If I work on this again I'll ditch
it completely and do forward raytracing for global illumination, then
some kind of normal rasterization pass with edge AA+good textures (or try
to combine them in some way so it can still have camera effects).

=======================================
Neat parts
=======================================

* Better-than-bilinear texture interpolation
* Attempts to be more correct than usual for image import/export - 
images are properly converted between sRGB and linear FP RGB using noise shaping.
* Simulates unpolarized Fresnel equations (well, the partial form usually given, anyway)
* A backtracking hack for caustics without doing global illumination
* SSSE3 accelerated vector class
* A somewhat-successful adaptive/nonlinear texture interpolation algorithm,
which I should put in its own program

=======================================
Not-neat parts
=======================================

* It's unreadable. Although I'd like to think it's better than the tutorials 
I read first (which are full of bad code written by people who learned style
from Windows C++ programming)
* No collision acceleration structure. kd-tree is easy, I just never got around to it.
It is pretty fast considering this+backtracking, though.
* The texture interpolation has a fixed-sized support (since determining the correct support
is impossible with ray tracing, unless you do beam tracing or ray differentials, and I don't
understand either), so it'll look bad if textures are effectively downsized.
* You can only do spheres and checkerboards, which means I'm in Raytracing Hell
* And you have to declare them all in code
